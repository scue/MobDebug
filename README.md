# Project Description

MobDebug is a remote debugger for Lua (including Lua 5.1, Lua 5.2, Lua 5.3, Lua 5.4, and LuaJIT 2.x).

## Features

MobDebug allows to control the execution of another Lua program remotely,
set breakpoints, and inspect the current state of the program.

Mobdebug is a cross-platform debugger, which not only works on Windows, macOS, and Linux, but
also supports debugging with the application and debugger running on different platforms.

It also supports source maps, which allows debugging of Lua-based languages,
like [Moonscript](http://notebook.kulchenko.com/zerobrane/moonscript-debugging-with-zerobrane-studio)
and [GSL-shell](http://notebook.kulchenko.com/zerobrane/gsl-shell-debugging-with-zerobrane-studio).

MobDebug is based on [RemDebug](http://www.keplerproject.org/remdebug/) and
extends it in several ways:

* added support for Lua 5.2, Lua 5.3, and Lua 5.4;
* added support for LuaJIT debugging;
* added support for cross-platform debugging (client and server running on different platforms/filesystems);
* added new commands: LOAD, RELOAD, OUT, STACK, DONE;
* added ability to pause and abort running applications;
* added pretty printing and handling of multiple results in EXEC;
* added stack and local/upvalue value reporting (STACK);
* added on/off commands to turn debugging on and off (to improve performance);
* added support for coroutine debugging (see examples/README for details);
* added support for varargs in stack trace;
* added support for vararg expressions in EXEC;
* added support for source maps;
* added support for debugging nginx/OpenResty, Lapis, and wxwidgets applications;
* removed dependency on LuaFileSystem;
* provided integration with [ZeroBrane Studio IDE](http://studio.zerobrane.com/).

## Usage

```lua
-- to start a server you can use to debug your application
> lua -e "require('mobdebug').listen()"

-- to debug a script, add the following line to it:
require("mobdebug").start()
```

Docker:
```lua
local mobdebug = require('mobdebug');
mobdebug.rbasedir("/usr/local/openresty/nginx/lua/") -- set remote directory
mobdebug.lbasedir("/Users/scue/source/someproject/nginx/lua/") -- set local directory
mobdebug.start("host.docker.internal", 18172);
```

## Installation

Make `src/mobdebug.lua` available to your script.
See `examples/README` and `examples/*.lua` for examples of how to use the module.

## Dependencies

MobDebug depends on LuaSocket 2.0+ and has been tested with Lua 5.1, Lua 5.2, Lua 5.3, and Lua 5.4.
MobDebug also works with LuaJIT v2.0+; using `loop` and `scratchpad` methods requires v2.0.1.
